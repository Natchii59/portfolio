I am currently studying for a BTS SIO (Computer Services for Organisations) to be able to discover new languages and technologies. I am at <a href='https://www.gastonberger.fr/' target='_blank'>Gaston Berger</a>, in Lille. I chose the SLAM option which is oriented in web and application development.

During my first year I practiced several subjects in computer science, such as SLAM, SISR (network oriented), Cybersecurity, as well as Professional Activities (these are large group programming projects).

### In SLAM I learned:

- Javascript on the browser side
- PHP with MySQL database integration
- The basics of JAVA
- Database management

### In SISR I learned:

- Create virtual machines
- Setting up an Active Directory on Windows
- Installing RAIDS

### In Cybersecurity I learned:

- Create a Kali-Linux machine to decrypt passwords
- Password encryption

I chose to do my second year as work-study program, keeping the SLAM option to learn more about web and application development. In SLAM, I am currently learning C# for building thick client applications. Also Dart for mobile applications.
