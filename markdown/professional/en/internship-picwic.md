I did a 2 month internship at <a href='https://www.smythstoys.com/fr/fr-fr' target='_blank'>PicwicToys</a> for the end of my first year of BTS SIO. I was located in Villeneuve d'Ascq. During my internship I was able to discover for the first time, programming in the corporate world. I was able to learn techniques on Git to manage large projects in a team. As well as discovering the <a href='https://www.atlassian.com/fr/software/jira' target='_blank'>Jira</a> tool for bug tickets or new features to bring to the website.

I was in frontend development. It was composed of VueJS, Typescript, and a lot of other things that I didn't have the opportunity to discover. I was able to take care of a lot of tickets concerning bugs or new things to implement.

During my internship I redesigned the homepage with a new KCMS/CMS integration. In this one it was possible to manage the content of the homepage, to be able to put several types of components with the content that one wished. I also participated in the redesign of the product sheets, the shopping cart page and the payment page, to integrate the new delivery promises (express delivery, ClickAndCollect, Mondial Relay, etc...).

I also had the opportunity to discover different areas of the company (apart from programming). Being able to help with some SQL queries, to simplify them and make them easier to understand and use.

For me this internship was a very good first experience in the company world, in the IT field. I was able to discover many aspects of programming in a team, and supervised.
