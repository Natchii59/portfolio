I went during my high school years <a href='https://marguerite-de-flandre-gondecourt.enthdf.fr/' target='_blank'>Marguerite de Flandre</a> in Gondecourt. I chose the 3 specialities NSI (Computer Science), Mathematics, and Physics Chemistry. Then for the year of Terminale I kept NSI and Mathematics.

In NSI, we saw the basics of programming with Python. This allowed me to see the syntaxes, as well as the Algorithms.
