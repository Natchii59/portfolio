  "home.about.text": "I am a student in a work-study program and a FullStack developer. I live in France, near Lille. I started programming in 2019 and since then, it has become my passion. I love coding, being able to create content on the internet. I am a FullStack developer, even if I lean more towards the backend side. I also like to do some design even if it's not my strong point. Online or offline, I listen to a lot of music. I have done several small projects to practice in different technologies. I'm never short of ideas.",

  "workflow.experience.text-1": "I started programming in 2019 by creating a Discord bot in Javascript and Node.js. I continued for a long time and only on this language, the confinement in March 2020 allowed me to dedicate myself to it full time. Then, after having learned a lot from it, I turned to web development, on the browser side. This is where I started with Vuejs, and then I moved on to React.",
  "workflow.experience.text-2": "A long time later, I discovered Typescript, and when I saw that it was an advanced version of Javascript, which was my favourite language, I practised on it. It became my main language that I use almost all the time in my projects. I had to switch to React Typescript, and then I got interested in creating APIs, where I started with GraphQL APIs with the NestJS framework.",
